# My best chess game, so far

Game played in the Open Queima das Fitas in 2024 against **IM Jos√© Veiga**.


This is an interesting game where I outplayed my opponent in the middlegame! To be honest, this isn't my best game, but it's the one in which I've had the most success against the strongest players. For me, this is a very impressive feat due to how strong my opponent is. One of the key thoughts I had, which allowed me to gain the upper hand, was striving for piece activity (Nf4 maneuver) and activating my rooks along the b-file with pawn play! Unfortunately, I blundered on the last move, but after ...Bxe6, Rb7! was a winning move because it threatens both the queen and checkmate.
