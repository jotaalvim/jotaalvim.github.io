# My best chess game, so far

Game played in the Open Queima das Fitas in 2024 against **IM Jos√© Veiga**.


Amazing game where I really outplayed him in the middlegame! One of the thoughts I had was on feeling for piece activity (Nf4 maneuver) and activating my rooks along the b-file with pawn play! Unfortunately, I blundered the last move, but after ...Bxe6, Rb7! was a winning move.
