# My best chess game, so far

Game played in the Open Queima das Fitas in 2024 against **IM Jos√© Veiga**.

Amazing game where I outplayed my opponent in the middlegame! One of the thoughts I had was constantly thriving for piece activity (Nf4 maneuver) and activating my rooks along the b-file with pawn play! Unfortunately, I blundered the last move, but after ...Bxe6, Rb7! was a winning move because it threatens the queen and checkmate.
